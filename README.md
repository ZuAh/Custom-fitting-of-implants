# Universal guide for skull extraction and custom-fitting of implants to continuous and discontinuous skulls

Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide transcranial access to the brain. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on na√Øve animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails, if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs with constant material thickness along the skull curvature, e.g. to allow fixed screw lengths. We present a universal step-by-step guide for custom-fitting implants which overcomes these limitations. It is suited for unusual skull conditions, like surface discontinuities or irregularities and includes virtual bending as a process to match skull surfaces while maintaining implant thickness. We demonstrate its applicability for a wide spectrum of scenarios, ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multi-component implant systems built on even or discontinuous skull. The guide uses only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. A detailed description of this process is available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions suitable for users without any prior knowledge in CAD programming. We report the experience with these implants over several years in 11 rhesus monkeys.

This repository provides a detailed step-by-step tutorial to design and custom-fit implants. The main PDF document 'EDT_Tutorial_ReadMe' will guide you through the individual steps, which are completed by video tutorials indicated in red.
